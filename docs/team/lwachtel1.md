## Project: ByteCeps
BYTE-CEPS is a CLI-based tool for setting and tracking fitness goals. 
The user interacts with the tool using commands entered via the CLI interface. With BYTE-CEPS, they can compile a list of exercises, build custom workouts, assign workouts to a weekly schedule and log details of each exercise completed in each performed workout. 

BYTE-CEPS is written in Java, and has approximately 5.6 kLoC.

## My Contributions

### Features
+ **Help menu**:  Shows the user how to correctly format each possible BYTE-CEPS command.
    + What it does: Upon initial program execution, a message detailing the commands to access the help menu is displayed. A user can enter 1 of these commands to view 3 different lists, each one with numbered items describing the functionalities associated with a category tracked by BYTE-CEPS. They can then see a given functionality's specific command formatting by entering the previous command along with the number from its help menu list position as a flag.
    + Justification: The user can make full use of BYTE-CEPS with easy access to guidance for its commands. If they enter a command incorrectly, they can quickly check the exact formatting in-program.
    + Credits: I wrote the initial HelpMenuManager class, and **_joshualeejunyi_** & **_pqienso_** refined my code. 


+ **Editing an exercise**: Allows user to change name of an already created exercise.

### Enhancements to existing features 
+ **`validators` package & its accompanying classes**: Ensures our classes within the processing package follow the single responsibility principle (SRP).
     + What it does: Each `Validator`-type class parses the inputs provided for the methods in its corresponding `Manager` class, checking input validity according to conditional statements and throwing exceptions if invalid.
     + Justification: This abstracts the input parsing & validation process out of the `Manager`-type classes, thus ensuring they have a single responsibility, which is user command execution.
     + Credits: I wrote the initial validators package. Each class method within a `Validator`-type class was public and corresponded to a `Manager` method by which it was called to parse & validate input, before the `Manager` method executed its task.
      **_pqienso_** significantly improved said package by changing each `Validator`-type class to have only one public method, which is  called from the `Validator`-type class `execute()` method. This public `Validator` method calls another private method that validates input for the specific private `Manager` method that `execute()` has called to execute the user's command. 
+ **Testing: `Storage` methods**: Enables my teammates and I, as well as any future developers, to ensure that all methods within the `Storage` class are working properly. 75% of method within `Storage` are covered.
    + What it does: It tests that the public methods within the `Storage` class, `save()` and `load()`, run successfully under conditions where their success is expected and throw exceptions under conditions where their failure is expected.
    + Justification: These tests allow developers to detect bugs within the covered methods, which is especially important after they have made any alterations to their constituent code.
    + Credits: I wrote all test methods within the `StorageTest` class and the helper methods for file handling. **_joshualeejunyi_** wrote `setup()`, `setUpStreams()`and `restoreStreams()`, which are integral to the functioning of the test methods.
+ **Testing: `ExerciseManager` method for editing an exercise**: Enables my teammates and I, as well as any future developers, to ensure that the functionality for editing an exercise name is working properly.
  + What it does: It tests that the `execute()` method in `ExerciseManager` edits an exercise under conditions where success is expected and throw exceptions under conditions where editing should fail.
  + Justification: These tests allow developers to detect bugs within the covered methods, which is especially important after they have made any alterations to their constituent code.
  + Credits: I wrote all test methods for editing an exercise. However, other tests written by my teammates acted as helpful guidance.
+ **Bug fixes**:
    + [Issue #114](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/issues/114): I implemented a [fix](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/pull/139) for a logging bug where a user was unable to log two of the same exercise on the same day; I did this by overriding the existing `equals()` method used by `ExerciseLog`, which was the bug's cause. 
    + [Issue #69](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/issues/69): Use of the `HashSet` class was causing incorrect ordering in exercise & workout lists, so I implemented a [fix](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/pull/92) by using the `LinkedHashSet` class instead.
    + [Issue #44](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/issues/44): I implemented [fixes](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F14-3/tp/pull/49) for unhandled exceptions for `week` (now called `program`).

### Code contributed 
[LWachtel1 RepoSense](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=lwachtel1&breakdown=true)

### Documentation:
+ **Javadocs**: I added Javadocs to all non-trivial methods in the `HelpMenuManager` and `HelpValidator` classes, as well as adding class header comments for both classes.
+ **UG**: Added user guidance for the `Help Menu` feature:
    + How to view the 3 different categories of help menu (each one corresponds to a different flag i.e., `exercise`, `workout` & `program`).
    + How to view a specific functionality's corresponding corresponding command format.
+ **DG**: Added implementation details of the `Help Menu` feature: 
    + descriptions of the execution processes for its two main functions: displaying numbered lists of flag-related functionalities and displaying a specific functionality's command format.
    + accompanying sequence diagrams 

### Community:
+ Reported an above-average number of bugs during the PE dry run, 8 bugs, for the team working on MediTracker.
